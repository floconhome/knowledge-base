- once installed, it discreet stays in the notification bar; you call it with a keyboard shorcut, default defined on "CTRL + ù" (can be modified); it is a great tool for professionnel workers who needs to copy/paste and search for data (text, pictures, and so on) all along their wroking days; it is also a great tools in a personal use for same reason; I use it since 2017: Jean-Marc, a co-worker in the professionnal team where I was, told me about it, and since then, I do not do without it 😉
