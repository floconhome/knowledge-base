- this greatful text tool is usefull for organising note taking and project code; I use it in professionnal context to organise my notes from a folder on my computer, read some data text files; in personal context, it helps me for android project, reading text and binary file; moreover, I especially like the dark theme and the syntaxic colors theme: it is eye relaxing
- in the second screenshot, I present you what is usefull for my usage:
1. the vertical left banner helps me see my folders/files tree, quickly having a look where I want to go
1. the main window, in dark theme, with syntaxic color theme
1. the global view on the right helps me quickly navigate throw the file being displayed in the main window; I win time when I use it
1. the search location on the bottom of the window can be used to search anything in the file displayed in the main window, and more, throw the folders/files tree in the vertical left banner; I do not use it often, but when I need, it is helpful

- once installed, it discreet stays in the notification bar; you call it with a keyboard shorcut, default defined on "CTRL + Ã¹" (can be modified); it is a great tool for professionnel workers who needs to copy/paste and search for data (text, pictures, and so on) all along their wroking days; it is also a great tools in a personal use for same reason; I use it since 2017: Jean-Marc, a co-worker in the professionnal team where I was, told me about it, and since then, I do not do without it ðŸ˜‰
